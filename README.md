# OpenFace-FaceLandmarkVidMulti-IncreasedFaces
A modification of the FaceLandmarkVidMulti.exe from the OpenFace Windows Distribution to accomodate for more than the original 4 face limit. 

This repo contains a modified version of the OpenFace FaceLandmarkVidMulti.exe tool, designed to accomodate for more than the hard-coded 4 face limit. The initial modified EXE currently accomodates a maximum of 20 faces.
